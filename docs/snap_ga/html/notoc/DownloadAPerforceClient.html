        In order to get Perforce up and running on your system, you first need to
        download the Perforce client program for your Operating System.
        Perforce Software provides clients for just about every OS freely on
        their web site at:

      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        All you need to do is download the appropriate p4 binary for your
        Operating System from their web site. You may also want to download or
        browse the documentation for p4, although it is quite simple to use
        from the command line and has extensive command line help.

        <p class="Note">
          Note:&#160;&#160;&#160; If you have not upgraded recently you should
          upgrade your copy of Perforce to 2002.1 or later, which has some new
          features that our Perforce server supports. However our depot should
          work with most Perforce clients right back to the 97.x series.

      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        In order to use Perforce you will need a TCP/IP connection to the
        internet, either via modem or direct connection. Accessing Perforce via
        modem is actually quite fast, and we regularly have developers doing
        remote development over slow modem links from around the world.
