        Refresh Rate Control
      </h3>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Once you have found the identifier for the display mode you wish to use,
        you can then call the <a href="SetVideoMode.html">SetVideoMode</a> function
        to set the display mode. One of the parameters to the <a href="SetVideoMode.html">SetVideoMode</a> function
        is the refresh rate to be used for the mode. In most normal situations
        you would pass a value of 0 for this parameter, which will set the
        currently selected default refresh rate for the mode. However it is
        possible for the application to directly specify the refresh rate to be
        used via two different methods.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The first method is to pass the desired refresh rate to the <a href="SetVideoMode.html">SetVideoMode</a> function
        as a specific value in Hz (ie: the integer value 60 for 60Hz etc).
        However this will only work if the refresh rate requested is actually
        supported by the display mode, so you need to first determine what
        refresh rates are supported. One of the bits of information returned by
        the <a href="GetVideoModeInfo.html">GetVideoModeInfo</a> function, is a
        complete list of all refresh rates for that display mode. This list of
        refresh rates will be properly filtered based on the capabilities of
        the underlying graphics hardware and the attached monitor (assuming a
        monitor has been selected by the user or detected automatically by Plug
        and Play). If you pass a value that is not listed in the information
        block returned by the <a href="GetVideoModeInfo.html">GetVideoModeInfo</a> function,
        the <a href="SetVideoMode.html">SetVideoMode</a> function will return
        –1, indicating failure.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The second method allows for refresh rates that are not listed as part of
        the drivers standard timings, such that an application can provide an
        exact set of CRTC timings to be used for the display mode (useful for
        flat panels and fixed frequency displays). Alternatively if the
        application just needs a non-standard, custom refresh rate, the
        application can use the VESA Generalised Timing Formula (GTF) functions
        provided to compute a set of generic CRTC timings for any arbitrary
        display mode and refresh rate (see <a href="GA_computeCRTCTimings.html">GA_computeCRTCTimings</a>).
        Once the application has used the GTF functions to compute a set of
        CRTC timings for the display mode, those CRTC timings can then be
        passed directly to the <a href="SetVideoMode.html">SetVideoMode</a> function
        along with use of the gaRefreshControl mode flag. This second method
        provides for the maximum versatility and support for specialised
        applications (such as fixed frequency monitors, LC stereo shutter
        glasses and head mounted displays).
