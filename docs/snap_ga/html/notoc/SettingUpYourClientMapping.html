        Setting up your client mapping
      </h3>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Once you are able to connect, you need to set up your client mapping
        since by default it will be empty. The client space is what allows you
        to map in only the portions of the software repository that you care
        about, and where to put them on your local system. The client
        information is then stored remotely on our server so it knows what
        files you have on your system and where they live (so if you delete
        stuff manually you will need to do a forced sync!).
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        To set up your client mapping, type:
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        p4 client
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        which will bring you into your editor of choice. It will include comments
        at the top about what parts of the file are used for what. There are
        two parts that you need to modify; the 'root' definition and the 'view'
        definition. The 'root' field is the root directory where all files get
        checked out onto your system, and this should be the root of the
        scitech directory (ie: /home/KendallB/scitech is where I put the
        sources on Unix systems, or c:\scitech for DOS, Windows and OS/2
        systems). For example:
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        Root:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; /home/KendallB/scitech
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The 'options' field defines what options are in effect for that client.
        The most important one you will want to change is the 'nocompress'
        option to 'compress'. By enabling compression, you will drastically
        reduce the time required for syncs over an internet connection! The
        second most useful option is to change the ‘normdir’ option to ‘rmdir’.
        This will have Perforce remove empty directories from the file system
        when all the files managed by Perforce are deleted and the directory is
        empty.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The 'view' field defines what parts of the perforce repository you want
        mapped to your local drive. The simplest mapping will pull down all the
        source files you would need (and the one you should probably use) would
        be:
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        View:<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; //depot/gpl/...
        //YOURNAME_YOURMACHINE_YOUROS/...
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        where you would replace the YOURNAME_YOURMACHINE_YOUROS above with the
        name of your client. This line indicates that all files and directories
        get mapped to the root of the client (or /home/KendallB/scitech if you
        uses the above root field). Now once you have the client view defined,
        exit your editor and it will send the changes to the perforce server.
