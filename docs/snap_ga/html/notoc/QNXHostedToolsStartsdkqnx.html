        The first thing you need to do is edit the bin/set-vars-qnx.sh script
        file to reference the location where you have installed the files, and
        the locations where all your compilers are installed. See the comments
        in set-vars-qnx.sh for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Once you have the startup file configured, you then need to run the
        following each time you start a command shell to enable the SciTech
        makefile utilities (a good idea to put into your startup scripts such
        as .bash_profile):
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        . ~/scitech/bin/set-vars-qnx.sh<br />
        . ~/scitech/bin/qnx4.sh
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The second script file sets up the compiler configuration for your
        default compiler. The line above sets up for Watcom C++ 10.6 for QNX.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Note that in the above script code, you need the source the script files
        to ensure the environment variables are exported to your regular shell.
        Hence make sure the leading '.' is included! 
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Note also that for QNX development you will need to set the USE_BIOS=1
        environment variable to enable support for calling the BIOS. You will
        also need to copy the vbios.lib files from the drivers/qnx directory
        into your runtime library directories. The final release will allow you
        to build SNAP programs without requiring the BIOS support, but for the
        moment the BIOS support is required to run under QNX, even though it is
        not used if you are running on SciTech SNAP drivers.
