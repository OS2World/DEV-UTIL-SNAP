      <h2>
        Using the Buffer Manager
      </h2>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The SciTech SNAP Graphics Architecture supports drawing on and copying
        video memory data to and from offscreen video memory and the display
        screen. Although the core functionality is provided via the <a href="SetDrawBuffer.html">SetDrawBuffer</a> function,
        the SciTech SNAP Graphics Architecture also supports a higher level
        interface to video memory mangement via the Buffer Manager. The Buffer
        Manager functions are provided through the <a href="GA_bufferFuncs.html">GA_bufferFuncs</a> function
        group, and implement support for allocating, freeing, displaying and
        copying data to and from offscreen video memory buffers. The buffers
        can be allocated entirely in video memory, entirely in system memory or
        to fall back to system memory when video memory runs out. The buffers
        can also be allocated as fixed or moveable buffers in video memory,
        where moveable buffers can be moved around in video memory by the
        buffer manager to collect free video memory for future buffer
        allocations. Buffers can also be implemented as discardable buffers
        with a system memory buffer cache, such that non-critical buffers can
        be pushed out to system memory automatically when more video memory is
        needed.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Using the Buffer Manager is actually quite simple. The first thing to do
        is to allocate the primary display buffer along with a set number of
        ‘flippable’ buffers that can be made visible for page flipping and
        animation. This is done using the <a href="InitBuffers.html">InitBuffers</a> function,
        where you will pass in the total number of flippable buffers that you
        need. To display a flippable buffer and make it visible, you would pass
        a pointer to the buffer to the <a href="FlipToBuffer.html">FlipToBuffer</a> function
        (pointers to the flip buffers can be obtained using the <a href="GetFlippableBuffer.html">GetFlippableBuffer</a> function).
        By default after initializing the buffer manager, all drawing will go
        to the first buffer or ‘primary’ buffer in the flippable buffers list.
        To make another buffer active for drawing, the <a href="SetActiveBuffer.html">SetActiveBuffer</a> function
        is used. After this function is called, all drawing using the functions
        in the <a href="GA_2DRenderFuncs.html">GA_2DRenderFuncs</a> function
        group will go to the newly active buffer.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Apart from flippable buffers, it is also possible to allocate arbitrary
        sized buffers in offscreen video memory using the <a href="AllocBuffer.html">AllocBuffer</a> function.
        You can allocate buffers with many different types of attributes with
        dimensions smaller or larger than the current display mode (some
        hardware does not support offscreen buffers larger than the display
        mode though). Once you have allocated the buffers, you can use them
        just like flippable buffers in that you can draw on them and copy
        between them, you just can’t make them directly visible via the <a href="FlipToBuffer.html">FlipToBuffer</a> function.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Once you have allocated a buffer (whether it is a flippable buffer or a
        regular offscreen buffer), if you wish to directly access the video
        memory in the buffer, you must use the <a href="LockBuffer.html">LockBuffer</a> and
        <a href="UnlockBuffer.html">UnlockBuffer</a> functions. Once you have
        called the <a href="LockBuffer.html">LockBuffer</a> function, the
        Surface pointer of the <a href="GA_buf.html">GA_buf</a> structure will
        point to a linear memory access that can be used to directly access the
        surface of the buffer. Prior to calling the <a href="LockBuffer.html">LockBuffer</a> function,
        the Surface pointer will be set to NULL (and will be reset to NULL
        after calling the <a href="UnlockBuffer.html">UnlockBuffer</a> function).
        The <a href="LockBuffer.html">LockBuffer</a> function also returns a
        physical memory address of the buffer in video memory, which can be
        used to program the video memory address into hardware DMA engines
        (note that not all drivers will support returning a physical memory
        address, and this will be 0 if not supported).
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        You can also directly copy data from any buffer to another buffer using
        the <a href="BitBltBuf.html">BitBltBuf</a> and related functions. This
        allows you to copy data between any source buffer and the currently
        active buffer, with all features normally available in the hardware
        such as color key transparency, stretching, blending and more.

        <p class="Note">
          Note:&#160;&#160;&#160; Another reason to use the buffer manager is
          that internally the SciTech SNAP Graphics Architecture drivers may
          utilize the buffer manager when it is enabled to speed up some
          software rendering functions through partial hardware acceleration.
          Until the application or shell driver enables the buffer manager,
          that functionality will not be enabled and those functions will run
          entirely in software.

          &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Also
          note that if you are using the DirectX SNAP driver on Microsoft
          Windows, you must use the buffer manager functions to manage
          offscreen video memory. Directly calling on this driver is not
          supported.
