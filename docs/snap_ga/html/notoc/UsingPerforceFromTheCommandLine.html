        Using Perforce from the command line
      </h3>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Using Perforce is very easy, and you can get help from the command line
        with:
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        p4 help
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The most common commands you might need to use are as follows.
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        p4 sync&#160;&#160;&#160; - Sync up with the latest sources<br />
        p4 edit&#160;&#160;&#160; - Open a file for editing<br />
        p4 add&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; - Add a new file to the repository<br />
        p4 delete&#160; - Delete a file from the repository<br />
        p4 resolve - Resolve conflicts if two people edit the same file<br />
        p4 revert&#160; - Revert changes for a currently opened file<br />
        p4 submit&#160; - Submit all changes to the repository<br />
        p4 opened&#160; - List call files you currently have opened
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The big difference between Perforce and other SCM systems like RCS is
        that Perforce is 'change' oriented. When you submit a change list,
        included in the change list will be all of the files that you currently
        have opened. If you don't want a file in that change list, simply
        delete it from the change list in the editor and it won't be submitted
        but will remain in your list of open files after the submit. You must
        provide a description for the change, and then the entire set of files
        associated with the change is submitted as a single atomic change to
        the server, including file additions and deletions! Hence when you need
        to revert back to older versions of the code, you can do it via the
        revision number for a specific file, a change list number to go back to
        the state when a particular change was submitted, or a label defined
        earlier.
