        What is SciTech SNAP?
      </h2>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The SciTech System Neutral Access Protocol, or SNAP, is an operating
        system portable, dynamically loadable, 32-bit device driver
        architecture. SciTech SNAP defines the architecture for loading an
        operating system neutral binary device driver for any type of hardware
        device, be it a graphics controller, audio controller, SCSI controller
        or network controller. SciTech SNAP drivers are source code portable
        between different microprocessor platforms, and the binary drivers are
        operating system portable within a particular microprocessor family.
        Hence the Intel x86 drivers can work on any 386+ CPU with any 32-bit
        operating system or environment supported on that CPU.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The main SciTech SNAP library for a particular device type is always
        contained in a single file that we call a ‘Binary Portable DLL’, or
        .bpd file. In the case of the Graphics Architecture, the driver file is
        named ‘graphics.bpd’ and always lives in the operating system specific
        SciTech SNAP driver directory, or in the drivers directory of the
        application using it. Internally the complete set of device support
        files may be spread across multiple files inside subdirectories, or all
        files may be optionally bound into a single, large binary file. The
        internal architecture of SNAP is such that only the necessary code to
        communicate with a specific device is actually loaded into memory at
        runtime, regardless of whether everything is bound into a single large
        binary file or maintained separately on disk. Loading only the
        necessary portions at runtime keeps the runtime memory footprint for
        the drivers exceptionally low. For instance even though the complete,
        statically bound graphics driver file may be well in excess of 8Mb,
        only a small portion of that (say around 250Kb) is actually loaded in
        memory at runtime to support a particular graphics device.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Due to the dynamic nature of the SciTech SNAP architecture, it is
        possible to bind together support for only a few specific hardware
        devices in a single binary library. For instance an industrial
        developer may only require support for the three graphics chipsets they
        install in their machines on a production line, so the total static
        size of the SNAP binaries can be significantly smaller. This can help
        save on disk and flash ROM space in highly embedded and industrial
        applications. SciTech SNAP also allows certain features to be ‘bound
        out’ of the resulting binary, further reducing disk space if those
        features are not required for a particular environment.
