        The first thing you need to do is edit the bin/set-vars-linux.sh script
        file to reference the location where you have installed the files, and
        the locations where all your compilers are installed. See the comments
        in set-vars-linux.sh for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Once you have the startup file configured, you then need to run the
        following each time you start a command shell to enable the SciTech
        makefile utilities (a good idea to put into your startup scripts such
        as .bash_profile):
      </p>
      <p class="Preformatted">
        . ~/scitech/bin/set-vars-linux.sh<br />
        . ~/scitech/bin/gcc-linux.sh
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        The second script file sets up the compiler configuration for your
        default compiler. The line above sets up for GNU C/C++ for Linux
        (eventually other compilers will be supported such as Borland Kylix).
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Note that in the above script code, you need to source the script files
        to ensure the environment variables are exported to your regular shell.
        Hence make sure the leading '.' is included!
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        If you are developing on an older libc5 based system (as opposed to the
        newer glibc as used by Red Hat 5.x and later), you will also need to
        set the LIBC=1 environment variable. This will tell our script files
        that you running on an older system and need to use the libc5 compiled
        binaries, and to put your compiled libraries into the libc5
        directories.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">
        Also in order to build the SNAP libraries, you should have the latest
        Linux 2.x kernel sources installed. The PM library depends upon a
        number of header files from the 2.x kernels (joystick.h and mtrr.h) in
        order to build. You can build for older kernels if you wish, but you
        will need to modify the PM library makefile to do this.
