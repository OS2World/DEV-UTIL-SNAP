                          SciTech SNAP MPEG player
                          ========================

This sample MPEG1 and MPEG2 video player is based on the mpeg2play
source code by Stefan Eckart. This was then ported to the SciTech
SNAP video overlay API's. This version only uses back end hardware
overlays for color conversion and scaling. It does not include
support for hardware motion compensation - please see the GAMPEG
sample program for that.

Important Licensing Information!
--------------------------------

Please note that Commercial implementations of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video,
including shareware, are subject to royalty fees to patent holders.  Many
of these patents are general enough such that they are unavoidable
regardless of implementation design.
