                          SciTech SNAP MPEG player
                          ========================

This sample MPEG1 and MPEG2 video player is based on the mpeg2play
source code by Stefan Eckart, which was ported to the XvMC interface
by Mark Vojkovich. This was then ported to the SciTech SNAP video
overlay API's, including the hardware motion compensation API's for
hardware accelerated DVD playback.
