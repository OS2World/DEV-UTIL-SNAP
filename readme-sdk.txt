                       Getting Started Guide


What is this document for?
--------------------------

This text document is intended to be a brief overview to help
developers determine which files to download to get started. This
document is *NOT* intended as a readme file to get you started
installing and using the SDK. For complete documentation on
installing and using the SciTech SNAP Graphics SDK, please refer
to the online HTML documentation pages found here:

 http://www.scitechsoft.com/docs/snap_ga


What files to download?
-----------------------

At a minimum you will need a copy of the source archive, the base
utilities archive for your OS and the SciTech SNAP device driver
binaries. Uncompress all files in the archives into the directory
on your system where you want the files to live (normally c:\scitech
or ~/scitech for Unix). You can optionally install the source code
for the base archive utilities as well as the SDK documentation in
HTML format (for offline browsing). The names of the archives
included in this release are:

 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-src.zip        - SNAP source archive in DOS/Win format
 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-win32.zip      - Win32 hosted base utilities
 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-os2.zip        - OS/2 hosted base utilities
 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-drivers.zip    - SciTech SNAP device driver binaries
 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-util.zip       - Source code for base utilities
 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-docs.zip       - SDK documentation in HTML format

 snap_sdk_3.1-r23-pdf.tar.gz     - SDK documentation in Adobe PDF format


Connecting with Perforce
------------------------

All of the source code for the SciTech SNAP SDK is managed by a public
software repository, using the commercial Perforce version management
system. Perforce Software has graciously allowed Open Source software
projects to be able to use a free server license for that source code.

If you wish to connect with Perforce, you can download a copy of the
entire public depot at the time the release was made. This contains a
lot more files than is distributed in the files listed above, but is
useful if you wish to avoid doing a large initial sync. You will need
one of the following files depending on the platform you are using, and
you will not need *any* of the files listed above:

 full_depot_r23.zip              - Complete copy of GPL depot in DOS/Win format
 full_depot_r23.tar.gz           - Complete copy of GPL depot in Unix format

For complete instruction on how to get connected via Perforce, please
