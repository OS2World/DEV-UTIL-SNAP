******************************* STRSTREAMBUF *********************************

Filename: ssfempsz.cpp
Declaration:
    strstreambuf::strstreambuf( int size )
Semantics: Create an empty strstreambuf that will use dynamic allocation
           of the specified size.


Filename: ssfempsf.cpp
Declaration:
    strstreambuf::strstreambuf( void *(*alloc)( long ), void (*free)( void * ) )
Semantics: Create an empty strstreambuf that will use dynamic allocation
           using the specified allocate/free functions.


Filename: ssfstbuf.cpp
Declaration:
    void strstreambuf::__strstreambuf( char *ptr, int size, char *pstart )
Semantics: Initialize a streambuf.


Filename: ssfdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    strstreambuf::~strstreambuf()
Semantics: Destroy a strstreambuf.


Filename: ssfstr.cpp
Declaration:
    char *strstreambuf::str()
Semantics: Freeze the strstreambuf, and return a pointer to the contents.


Filename: ssfoverf.cpp
Declaration:
    int strstreambuf::overflow( int c )
Semantics: The streambuf level has decided that its buffer is too small for the
           characters that the user is trying to put.


Filename: ssfundrf.cpp
Declaration:
    int strstreambuf::underflow()
Semantics: The streambuf has decided that it needs more characters for input.


Filename: ssfsetbf.cpp
Declaration:
    streambuf *strstreambuf::setbuf( char *, int size )
Semantics: Just remember the size to allocate next time.


Filename: ssfgpos.cpp
Declaration:
    streampos get_position( streamoff offset, ios::seekdir direction,
        char *base, char *ptr, char *end, char *extended_end )
Semantics: For "put" buffers, "extended_end" equals "end".
           For "get" buffers, "extended_end" may be greater than "end" if there
           are characters in the put area, allowing the seek to go beyond the
           end of the get area.
           The get area must then be extended.


Filename: ssfseeko.cpp
Declaration:
    streampos strstreambuf::seekoff( streamoff offset, ios::seekdir direction,
        int mode )
Semantics: Position either the get and/or put pointer to the specified position.


Filename: ssfdoall.cpp
Declaration:
    int strstreambuf::doallocate()
Semantics: Do the allocation required if allocate() thinks it's needed.


Filename: ssfsync.cpp
Declaration:
    int strstreambuf::sync()
Semantics: A strstreambuf can never be out of sync,
           so return "something other than EOF".



******************************* STRSTREAMBASE ********************************

Filename: ssbconde.cpp
Declaration:
    strstreambase::strstreambase()
Semantics: Construct a default strstreambase.


Filename: ssbconsz.cpp
Declaration:
strstreambase::strstreambase( char *str, int size, char *pstart )
             : __strstrmbuf( str, size, pstart ) 


Filename: ssbdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    strstreambase::~strstreambase()
Semantics: Destroy ststreambase.



******************************* ISTRSTREAM ***********************************

Filename: issconch.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( char *str ) : strstreambase( str, 0, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that will read from the NULLCHAR-delimited
           string pointed at by str.


Filename: issconsc.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( signed char *str )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, 0, NULL )

           string pointed at by str.


Filename: issconuc.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( unsigned char *str )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, 0, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that will read from the NULLCHAR-delimited
           string pointed at by str.


Filename: isscochz.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
           str for length size.


Filename: isscoscz.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( signed char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
           str for length size.


Filename: isscoucz.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::istrstream( unsigned char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
	   str for length size.


Filename: issdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    istrstream::~istrstream()
Semantics: Destroy istrstream object.



******************************* OSTRSTREAM ***********************************

Filename:
Declaration: ossconde.cpp
    ostrstream::ostrstream()
Semantics: Construct an empty ostrstream that may have characters placed in it.


Filename: ossconch.cpp
Declaration:
    ostrstream::ostrstream( char *str, int size, ios::openmode mode )
Semantics: Construct an ostrstream that will put characters into the buffer
	   starting at str for length size.


Filename: ossconsc.cpp
Declaration:

Semantics: Construct an ostrstream that will put characters into the buffer
           starting at str for length size.


Filename: ossdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    ostrstream::~ostrstream()
Semantics: Destroy the ostrstream object, which means destroying the
           strstreambuf buffer.
