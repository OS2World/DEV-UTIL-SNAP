Note: This file exists in order to make sure this directory
gets created.

If you have checked these files out of Perforce on a Windows
system, you will need to manually copy the monitor.dbx database
from the %SCITECH%\drivers\x86\config\graphics directory. On Unix 
the file should already be symlinked for you.
