                       Utility Source Code

What is in this archive?
------------------------

This archive contains the full source code to many of the utility programs
used by the SciTech SNAP SDK build system, such as the dmake utility,
NetWide assembler and SciTech developed makefile add on utilities. All of
the programs in this archive are completely stand alone, but some of them
have been ported to build using the SciTech SNAP SDK build system. Hence
you may need the SciTech SNAP SDK base build system installed in order to
build the programs contained in this archive.
